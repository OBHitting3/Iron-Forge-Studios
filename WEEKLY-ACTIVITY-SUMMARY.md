## Tools & Workflow Summary

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | Branch creation, Python conversions, AI bridge sync upgrades (branches prefixed `claude/`) |
| **Cursor (Background Agents)** | Primary development tool — all `cursor/` branches. Used for full MVP builds, security hardening, art direction prototypes, docs |
| **GitHub** | Central repository hosting, PR-based workflow, issue tracking for TODOs |

### Key Patterns

- **Cursor background agents** handle the bulk of code generation (MVPs, security layers, prototypes)
- **Claude Code** used for targeted conversions and integrations
- **PR-based workflow** with descriptive bodies documenting what each change delivers
- **Issue tracking** used to log outstanding TODOs found in code
